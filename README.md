# MHResdesign v1
## This repo is no longer maintained and has been discontinued as of Jan. 14, 2019

This repository served as my starting point for redesigning and recoding the website for Mentor High School and served as a way for me to dive head-in into my web development career. As I had no real prior web development experience, much of the code found here is undocumented, poorly written, and inefficient. Despite no longer maintaining or using the code found here, this initial version of the Mentor High revamp served as a beneficial learning ground.

This project with purpose and a real environment for production gave me an in-depth learning and improvement experience, in which I learned skills for both front-end and back-end development.

## Deployment
Local development was hosted through XAMPP (Apache 7.2, MySQL 7 + MariaDB), which was then pushed to this repo. An ARCH Linux server on the campus of Mentor High served as the public endpoint for the site.

## Built with
* [HTML/Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com) - Used this framework for less repetition for components, structure, layout, and the goal of reducing unnecessary development. Semantic HTML was of importance, but not followed through the entirety of the project
* [CSS/SASS] - CSS initially, which was then written in SASS and precompiled for the later life of the project
* [Javascript] - Little raw Javascript wrote, as I have (for some reason) for it to be more difficult to learn than other languages
* [jQuery] (https://jquery.com) - When JS was used, jQuery was the library which I wrote though
* [jQueryUI] (https://jqueryui.com) - Extension for jQuery, primarily used for interactions with the UI
* [PHP 7.2] - PHP served as the backend for the entirety of the project
* [MySQL] - Database used
